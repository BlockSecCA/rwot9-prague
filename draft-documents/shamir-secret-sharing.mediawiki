==Abstract==

Social key recovery allows users to collaborate with each other to securely recover their secrets instead of using centralized account reset procedures. Shamir secret sharing can be used as an implementation of social key recovery, where a secret can be split into a number of shares with various threshold requirements or in the future any arbitrary monotone boolean function describing a recovery policy.

SatoshiLabs' SLIP 39 is one proposed implementation of Shamir secret sharing with mnemonics. SLIP 39 implements simple Shamir secret sharing plus a two-level fixed threshold group, including a mnemonic text encoding scheme and an encryption scheme as well.

This proposal is loosely inspired by SLIP 39 but makes some different decisions. In particular, this new proposal includes a binary format, additional metadata (such as birthdate), and greater flexibility of threshold specification. It also has some optional templates for pre-defined or pre-parameterized threshold requirements. The design is intended to make it possible to independently audit the independent parts of the proposal and make the proposal more modular. The proposal is intended to be compatible with future upgrades like verifiable secret sharing and MuSig.

A reference implementation is provided as well.

==Motivation==

==Use cases==

**Social key recovery**: a user and his family, friends and colleagues collaborate to keep Shamir shards on behalf of the user.

**Commercial custodian**: a company has various teams of employees that are tasked with managing private keys and signing bitcoin transactions.

==Glossary==

Shard dealer: An individual that has a secret that is sharded using this secret sharing scheme. The user makes a number of shards that are dealt out to different users to turn each user into a shard custodian.

Deck: A collection of shards that together can be combined (in at least one way) to reconstruct the sharded secret.

Deck identifier: Derived from the sharded secret. It is the public key derived from the sharded secret unmodified with no derivation and no other modification. The deck identifier is a public key that uniquely identifies the deck. This key can sign each shard.

Script policy: A script that specifies a policy for how the deck's secret (seed entropy) can be reconstructed from some combination of shards.

Quorum: Any set of shards sufficient to meet the script policy for reconstruction.

Shard: A shard includes unencrypted metadata, an unencrypted Y value and checksum, and private encrypted data.

Shard unencrypted metadata (public metadata): Data associated with a shard that describes the shard and the deck among other things. This includes birthdate, deck identifier information, and so on.

Shard value: The mathematical or cryptographic value that can be used in the secret sharing scheme to reconstruct the sharded secret. This is the y value.

Private data (encrypted) (encrypted blob or deck blob): Encrypted data transferred with each shard. The decryption key can be computed by recombining all the shards.

Shard custodian: A user that holds a number of shards, possibly from multiple different decks.

Shard pool: A shard custodian can use software that implements a shard pool that contains their collection of shards they are responsible for. The shard pool allows for querying over the set of shards to find particular shards to respond to a request.

Sharded secret: Used to create the derived secret. This is used both as symmetric key and as a private key. This is a high entropy secret.

Derived secret: The derived secret is used to decrypt the identical private data associated with each shard.
