Abstract
This paper explores how to take a “reputation” trust graph, with multiple characteristics and create actionable output. 
We are looking to categorize the types of reputation people might have into general buckets, such as:

* Knowledge
* Emotional Intelligence 
* Generalized Skills
* Reviews from others
The output that we would produce is specific to each type of community or decision. 
For example:
* Yes/no 
* Graph or diagram 
* Report
* Derivative reputation assessment. For example, in moving from one sport to another, some skills might be transferrable and some not. 
* Complex adjustment to the terms of engagement. For example, if you are offering a job to someone, the output might be a change in their job description. 

There are many different ways that people are collecting data and different parameters about people. We need a reputation table of some metrics. The question is what do you once you have it? We want to divide the different categories of reputation that people might have, like knowledge or skills in a particular domain, emotional intelligence, and generalized skills. What kind of outputs would you have? This is actionable output like a yes/no output or it might be something a little more like a recommendation or a report about something. It might also be an interpretation of that person's reputation in your new system or new community. How do we take a reputation that this matrix that comes from many different sources, and what does the actionable output look like?
