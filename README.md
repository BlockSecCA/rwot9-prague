# Rebooting the Web of Trust IX: Prague (September 2019)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT9, the ninth
Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which will be held
in Prague, the Czech Republic, September 3rd to 6th, 2019. 

The goal of the workshop is to generate five technical white papers 
and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the 
greatest impact on the future.

## Final Papers

### [*Encrypted Data Vaults*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/encrypted-data-vaults.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/encrypted-data-vaults.md)
#### Amy Guy, David Lamers, Tobias Looker, Manu Sporny, Dmitri Zagidulin

> This paper describes current approaches and architectures, derived requirements, design goals, and dangers that implementers should be aware of when implementing data storage. This paper also explores the base assumptions of these sorts of systems such as providing privacy-respecting mechanisms for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data, as well as data portability.

### [*Reputation Interpretation*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-interpretation.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-interpretation.md)
#### Arthur Brock, Kaliya Hamlin, Grace (Rebecca) Rachmany, Jakub Lanc

> This paper explores how to take a "reputation" trust graph with multiple characteristics and create actionable output. It is not focused on the automation of the process, which could be applied by human processing of information or through a programmed software implementations.

## Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants are invited to contribute a
one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on
either:

   * A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
   * A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Topics & Advance Readings directory](topics-and-advance-readings) for all the current papers (and how to upload yours).
