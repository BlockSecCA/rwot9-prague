_This is a listing for the RWOT9 papers to date. [Several more](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/draft-documents/README.md) are in process._

## [*Decentralized Identity as a Meta-platform: How Cooperation Beats Aggregation*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/CooperationBeatsAggregation.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/CooperationBeatsAggregation.md)
#### by Michael Shea, Samuel M. Smith Ph.D., Carsten StÃ¶cker Ph.D.

> A meta-platform is a platform that enables and fosters participant-controlled value transfer across and among
other platforms and participants; because platforms are a type of network, a meta-platform enables a network
of network efects. This cooperation among platforms may be advantageous in comparison to centralized power
(non-cooperation) in some contexts, particularly where a new network scaling law for meta-platforms can be
argued to apply directly. An open, interoperable, portable, decentralized identity framework is a prime
candidate for becoming such a meta-platform and for leveraging this aggregate network efect.

> Signifcant momentum has been developing behind a universal decentralized identity system based on open
standards, including the W3C-supported decentralized identifer (DID) and verifable credential (VC) standards. Associated industry groups supporting this open standard include the Decentralized Identity Foundation
(DIF), the Sovrin Foundation, and the HyperLedger Foundation projects Indy, Aries, and Ursa.

> The purpose of this paper is to foster awareness of the economic benefts of cooperation and the crucial role
decentralized identity may play in unleashing new sources of value creation and transfer among cooperating
platforms.

## [*Encrypted Data Vaults*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/encrypted-data-vaults.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/encrypted-data-vaults.md)
#### Amy Guy, David Lamers, Tobias Looker, Manu Sporny, Dmitri Zagidulin

> This paper describes current approaches and architectures, derived requirements, design goals, and dangers that implementers should be aware of when implementing data storage. This paper also explores the base assumptions of these sorts of systems such as providing privacy-respecting mechanisms for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data, as well as data portability.

## [*Reputation Interpretation*](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-interpretation.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/reputation-interpretation.md)
#### Arthur Brock, Kaliya Hamlin, Grace (Rebecca) Rachmany, Jakub Lanc

> This paper explores how to take a "reputation" trust graph with multiple characteristics and create actionable output. It is not focused on the automation of the process, which could be applied by human processing of information or through a programmed software implementations.
