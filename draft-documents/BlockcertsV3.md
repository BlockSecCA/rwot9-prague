# Blockcerts V3.0

Anthony Ronning <aronning@learningmachine.com> (Learning Machine), Wong Wai Chung <waichung@nextid.com> (NextID)

## Abstract

As the standards around verifiable credentials are starting to take form, different flavors of â€˜verifiable credentials-like` data structures need to make necessary changes to leverage on the rulesets outlined and constantly reviewed by a knowledgeable community like RWOT and W3C. The purpose of this paper is to identify all of the changes needed for Blockcerts to comply with the [Verifiable Credentials](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) (VC's) & [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) (DID's) standards, and the additional benefits by using a blockchain in combination with Verifiable Credentials. This paper is to act as an explainer in which a formal spec can be created.

Throughout this paper, there can be multiple implementation options for several properties. The intention is that we can engage the Blockcerts / Verifiable Credential communities and see what fits best. 

## Verifiable Credential Schema

Verifiable Credentials are a data schema that is defined and published as a Proposed Recommendation to W3C. It seeks to represent the same information that a physical credential represents that are also tamper-evident and more trustworthy while also addressing future considerations in our societies that are becoming increasingly digitalized. Some of these concerns include but are not limited to privacy-preserving goals.

An example of a minimally viable Verifiable Credential can be seen below: 

```
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2"
  ],

  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenBadgesV2"],

        "value": "Awesome Robotics Badge",
        "lang": "en",
        "description": "For doing awesome things with robots that people think is pretty great.",
      }]
    }
  },

  }
}
```


## Open Badges & Blockcerts Schema

### Open Badges

Currently, Blockcerts is an Extension to [Open Badges](https://openbadges.org/), which is a specification and open technical standard originally developed by the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org). Open Badges is widely adopted by Universities and Microcredential platforms as a way to issue achievements and allows recipients to hold and collect them into "backpacks". The benefit of using a blockchain as an extension to Open Badges is to provide immutability and proof of existence.

An example standard Open Badge can be seen below:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
  "type": "Assertion",
  "id": "https://example.org/beths-robotics-badge.json",
  "recipient": {
    "type": "email",
    "hashed": true,
    "salt": "deadsea",
    "identity": "sha256$c7ef86405ba71b85acd8e2e95166c4b111448089f2e1599f42fe1bba46e865c5"
  },
  "issuedOn": "2016-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "badge": {
    "id": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.json",
    "type": "BadgeClass",
    "name": "Awesome Robotics Badge",
    "description": "For doing awesome things with robots that people think is pretty great.",
    "image": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.png",
    "criteria": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.html",
    "issuer": {
      "type": "Profile",
      "id": "https://example.org/organization.json",
      "name": "An Example Badge Issuer",
      "image": "https://example.org/logo.png",
      "url": "https://example.org",
      "email": "steved@example.org",
    }
  },
  "verification": {
    "type": "hosted"
  }
}
```

It can be separated into 3 parts, the assertion, the badge, and the issuer. 


Assertion

```json
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
  "type": "Assertion",
  "id": "https://example.org/beths-robotics-badge.json",
  "recipient": {
    "type": "email",
    "hashed": true,
    "salt": "deadsea",
    "identity": "sha256$c7ef86405ba71b85acd8e2e95166c4b111448089f2e1599f42fe1bba46e865c5"
  },
  "image": "https://example.org/beths-robot-badge.png",
  "evidence": "https://example.org/beths-robot-work.html",
  "issuedOn": "2016-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "badge": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.json",
  "verification": {
    "type": "hosted"
  }
}
```

`Assertion.badge` resolves into the below:

Badge

```json
{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "type": "BadgeClass",
    "id": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.json",
    "type": "BadgeClass",
    "name": "Awesome Robotics Badge",
    "description": "For doing awesome things with robots that people think is pretty great.",
    "image": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.png",
    "criteria": "https://example.org/robotics-badge.html",
    "issuer": "https://example.org/organization.json",
}
```

`Assertion.badge.issuer` resolves into the below:

Issuer

```json
{
    "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "type": "Profile",
    "id": "https://example.org/organization.json",
    "name": "An Example Badge Issuer",
    "image": "https://example.org/logo.png",
    "url": "https://example.org",
    "email": "steved@example.org",
}
```


### Blockcerts

Blockcerts follows this model as well but with additional fields that allow it to be anchored by a blockchain. 

An example of a Blockcerts can be seen below:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2.1"
  ],
  "type": "Assertion",
  "id": "urn:uuid:bbba8553-8ec1-445f-82c9-a57251dd731c",
  "badge": {
    "id": "urn:uuid:82a4c9f2-3588-457b-80ea-da695571b8fc",
    "type": "BadgeClass",
    "name": "Certificate of Accomplishment",
    "image": "data:image/png;base64,...",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, mei docendi concludaturque ad, cu nec partem graece. Est aperiam consetetur cu, expetenda moderatius neglegentur ei nam, suas dolor laudem eam an.",
    "criteria": {
      "narrative": "Nibh iriure ei nam, modo ridens neglegentur mel eu. At his cibo mucius."
    },
    "issuer": {
      "id": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json",
      "type": "Profile",
      "name": "University of Learning",
      "url": "https://www.issuer.org",
      "email": "contact@issuer.org",
      "revocationList": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/revocation-list-testnet.json",
      "image": "data:image/png;..."
    }
  },
  "recipient": {
    "hashed": false,
    "identity": "eularia@landroth.org",
    "type": "email"
  },
  "recipientProfile": {
    "type": [
      "RecipientProfile",
      "Extension"
    ],
    "publicKey": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:mtr98kany9G1XYNU74pRnfBQmaCg2FZLmc",
    "name": "Eularia Landroth"
  },
  "issuedOn": "2017-06-29T14:58:57.461422+00:00",
  "verification": {
    "publicKey": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:msBCHdwaQ7N2ypBYupkp6uNxtr9Pg76imj",
    "type": [
      "MerkleProofVerification2017",
      "Extension"
    ]
  },
  "signature": {
    "type": [
      "MerkleProof2017",
      "Extension"
    ],
    "targetHash": "637ec732fa4b7b56f4c15a6a12680519a17a9e9eade09f5b424a48eb0e6f5ad0",
    "merkleRoot": "f029b45bb1a7b1f0b970f6de35344b73cccd16177b4c037acbc2541c7fc27078",
    "anchors": [
      {
        "sourceId": "d75b7a5bdb3d5244b753e6b84e987267cfa4ffa7a532a2ed49ad3848be1d82f8",
        "type": "BTCOpReturn",
        "chain": "bitcoinMainnet"
      }
    ],
    "proof": [
      {
        "right": "11174e220fe74de907d1107e2a357e41434123f2948fc6b946fbfd7e3e3eecd1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Besides some of the minor differences in layout/metadata between the example Blockcerts and example Open Badge, the main differences in schema (ie, the Blockcerts extensions), are below.

**RecipientProfile** 

[Schema link](https://www.blockcerts.org/schema/2.0/recipientSchema.json)

```json
"recipientProfile": {
    "type": [
      "RecipientProfile",
      "Extension"
    ],
    "publicKey": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:mtr98kany9G1XYNU74pRnfBQmaCg2FZLmc",
    "name": "Eularia Landroth"
  }
```

This allows for additional recipient information that can be used to make a strong claim of ownership over the credential. In addition to the `name` and `publicKey` properties in this example, there is an `id` field in this schema that is reserved for future uses of DIDs. 


**Verification** 

[Schema link](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/cert-schema/blob/master/docs/open_badge_v2_extensions.md)

```json
"verification": {
    "publicKey": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:msBCHdwaQ7N2ypBYupkp6uNxtr9Pg76imj",
    "type": [
      "MerkleProofVerification2017",
      "Extension"
    ]
  }
```

In this case, Verification is an Open Badge `VerificationObject` with a `MerkleProofVerification2017` extension to allow for the `publicKey` of the issuer. It is used during the verification step of Blockcerts to ensure that the issuer public key matches the public key creating the blockchain transaction with this credential.

One of the last major differences is `Signature` with the MerkleProof2017 extension

**Signature** 

[Schema link](https://www.blockcerts.org/schema/2.0/merkleProof2017Schema.json)

```json
"signature": {
    "type": [
      "MerkleProof2017",
      "Extension"
    ],
    "targetHash": "637ec732fa4b7b56f4c15a6a12680519a17a9e9eade09f5b424a48eb0e6f5ad0",
    "merkleRoot": "f029b45bb1a7b1f0b970f6de35344b73cccd16177b4c037acbc2541c7fc27078",
    "anchors": [
      {
        "sourceId": "d75b7a5bdb3d5244b753e6b84e987267cfa4ffa7a532a2ed49ad3848be1d82f8",
        "type": "BTCOpReturn",
        "chain": "bitcoinMainnet"
      }
    ],
    "proof": [
      {
        "right": "11174e220fe74de907d1107e2a357e41434123f2948fc6b946fbfd7e3e3eecd1"
      }
    ]
}
```

In this property, we go through all of the Merkle proofs required to validate a hash against a Merkle root hash on a blockchain. For more information on this procedure, visit the [MerkleProof2017 spec](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-merkleproof2017/).



**Issuer** 

Most of the properties in `issuer` come directly from the Open Badges spec, an example of a Blockcerts' "Issuer Profile" can be seen below:

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2"
  ],
  "type": "Profile",
  "id": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json",
  "name": "University of Learning",
  "url": "https://www.issuer.org",
  "introductionURL": "https://www.issuer.org/intro/",
  "publicKey": [
    {
      "id": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:msBCHdwaQ7N2ypBYupkp6uNxtr9Pg76imj",
      "created": "2017-06-29T14:48:03.814936+00:00"
    }
  ],
  "revocationList": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/revocation-list-testnet.json",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
  "email": "contact@issuer.org"
}
```

When verifying a Blockcert, the Issuer is checked to ensure that its public key anchored the Blockcert to the blockchain. After this check, the `revocationList` is checked to ensure that the issuer has not revoked their credential.

One field added to this is the `IntroductionURL`. 

**IntroductionURL**

This is used for a client (ie, Blockcerts Wallet) to do a POST API call to transmit their public key to the issuer for them to include the key in the `RecipientProfile` of a Blockcerts.


More information about the exact schema being used for Blockcerts can be found [here](https://www.blockcerts.org/schema/2.0/context.json) & general information [here](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-schema/blob/master/docs/schema-2.md).


This URL-based "Issuer Profile" will be improved by using DID's for issuers. More on this in [Issue Profile](#issuer-profile). 


## Blockcerts as VC Implementation

Focusing on the Blockcerts specific additions to Open Badges (`recipientProfile`, `verification`, and `signature`) we can make the following mappings over to a VC.

### `recipientProfile`
This part could essentially go away and be replaced with `credentialSubject.id` and `credentialSubject.name`. 


```json
"recipientProfile": {
    "type": [
      "RecipientProfile",
      "Extension"
    ],
    "publicKey": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:mtr98kany9G1XYNU74pRnfBQmaCg2FZLmc",
    "name": "Eularia Landroth"
  }
```

can become 

```json
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:mtr98kany9G1XYNU74pRnfBQmaCg2FZLmc",
    "name": "Eularia Landroth",
    "alumniOf": {
      "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",
      "name": [{
        "value": "Example University",
        "lang": "en"
      }, {
        "value": "Exemple d'UniversitÃ©",
        "lang": "fr"
      }]
    }
  }
```

Blockcerts currently uses a `ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey` for the recipient. Since this is a valid URI, it can be also be used for verifiable credentials. Ideally, a DID is used instead to be better supported throughout the VC/DID ecosystem.

### `verification` 

As specified in "BC V2 Schema & Examples" above, `verification` is used to verify the public key of the issuer matches the public key used to issue the transaction to a blockchain. 

This might be considered a redundant property since the Verifiable Credential will have a proof property that verifies immutability as well, the "issuer profile" already specifies their keys used for issuing, and the key used for issuing will be known when resolving the blockchain transaction.

Unless there's a strong reason to keep this property in Blockcerts as it moves to the VC schema, it should be suggested to remove it in V3.


#### Signature / Proof Proposal

Verifiable Credentials require a `proof` property that is used for verifying the immutability of a VC as well as proving that a certain issuer is the one that signed the VC. Before VC, Blockcerts used `signature` to prove immutability. What role does `signature` provide if we are already required to implement `proof`? 

One important property that all `proof` methods do not provide alone with typical signing keys is the aspect of time stamping. A `created` date can be applied to `proof`, but since that can be created with any date, we cannot prove it existed at a certain time. Using a blockchain can be beneficial here, as it proves that the document existed with a high degree of certainty at the time of the transaction (collisions technically can still occur due to hashing, though improvable). 

To be Verifiable Credential compliant, we need to use a different signature proof. Currently, [`MerkleProof2019`](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-merkle-proof-2019/) is being spec'd out and will be compliant with VC's.

While multiple signatures are allowable in a VC, the Blockcerts spec should only specify that a blockchain proof is required. There may be benefits to supplying both an RSA signature (as an example) and a `MerkleProof2019` signature so that there may be better interoperability for verifiers that might not support `MerkleProof2019` yet.

Example

```json
...
[Cert Data Hash]
...
  "proof": {
      "type": "MerkleProof2019",
      "creator": "did:example:abcdefghij0123456789",
      "created": "2017-09-23T20:21:34Z",
      "domain": "example.org",
      "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
      "proofValue":
  "z76WGJzY2rXtSiZ8BDwU4VgcLqcMEm2dXdgVVS1QCZQUptZ5P8n5YCcnbuMUASYhVNihae7m8VeYvfViYf2KqTMVEH1B
  }
```

Note: in the new `MerkleProof2019`, `proofValue` is a CBOR encoding of the JSON that would have been present in `MerkleProof2017`. 

The above gets decoded to:

```json
{
    "merkleRoot": "3c9ee831b8705f2fbe09f8b3a92247eed88cdc90418c024924be668fdc92e781",
    "targetHash": "c65c6184e3d5a945ddb5437e93ea312411fd33aa1def22b0746d6ecd4aa30f20",
    "path": [{
      "right": "51b4e22ed024ec7f38dc68b0bf78c87eda525ab0896b75d2064bdb9fc60b2698"
    }, {
      "right": "61c56cca660b2e616d0bd62775e728f50275ae44adf12d1bfb9b9c507a14766b"
    }],
    "anchors": [{
      "sourceId": "582733d7cef8035d87cecc9ebbe13b3a2f6cc52583fbcd2b9709f20a6b8b56b3",
      "type": "BTCOpReturn"
    }] 
}
```

#### Issuer Key Revocations 

In addition to proof of existence, using a Blockchain can get additional benefits when factoring in revocation use cases. Say a non-blockchain based VC was signed with an RSA key. The Signature Proof has a `createdDate` associated with the signature, but we cannot prove that date is correct in actuality. Simply that the person/process signing the key claimed that as the time they signed. 

In most cases, the issuer signing with keys they own should be signing with the correct time. However, in situations where the signing key was stolen, the thief might want to issue a credential in the past to make it appear as though they, for instance, graduated with a degree at a college when they first started issuing VC's. 

The college realizes their key was stolen, compromised, or simply they practice good key rotation hygiene. In any of these cases, the true issuer now revokes that key with an expiration date set to a day before the known theft. 

Since credential dates can not be trusted, we can not determine which credentials fall within the `createdDate` & `revocationDate` range for a given key. Every single credential issued with a key that was stolen NEEDS to fail (or at least warn) for signing key verification problems during the credential verification process. One bad credential issued with a stolen key can affect the status of every single recipient that received a credential from that issuer with that specific signing key. This is not satisfactory when it comes to life-long credentials. 

Therefore, by utilizing the trusted timestamps of a blockchain, we can calculate the true issuance date and determine that if an issuer revoked/expired a signing key for a specific date, every credential that has an anchor on a blockchain before that date is unaffected by key revocations. 

### Additional Fields

In addition to the existing fields specified above, there are several fields in Blockcerts V2 that have had non-standard support in the ecosystem that could benefit from being standardized. 

#### `display`

In Blockcerts V2, we've been building a lot of support for `displayHtml` unofficially. In mobile wallets, verifiers, etc. As well as 3rd party libraries built for it as well. 

Proposing for V3, it would be great if we can throw in official support for displays. Extending past `displayHtml`, we should allow support for any type of display. Some may not want to use `html` but instead use `pdf`, an `image`, etc. 

**Option 1**
For the schema, it can simply be `type` and `data` properties.

Example:

```json
"display": {
    "type": "html",
    "data": "<p>hello world</p>"
}
```


**Option  2**

Alternatively, we can use [DATA URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) instead. 

```json
"display": "data:text/html,%3Ch1%3EHello%2C%20World!%3C%2Fh1%3E"
```


In the beginning, the official Blockcerts Universal Verifier might only support HTML officially, but it does allow others to create valid Blockcerts with different display types. The official verifier should fall back to a default display when it does not understand a Data URL like it does today when `displayHtml` is missing.


#### `metadata`

Similar to the above `display`/`displayHtml` section, we similarily do not have an official standard around the use of the `metadatajson` property we have. We have unofficial support in both the mobile app & verifier to display some metadata information to the viewer. 

**Option 1**
We could add this to the standard, but allow for different types of metadata format, maybe `XSD` for example, it would allow issuers to take advantage of that, and continue to support it officially in some of the Blockcerts ecosystems. 

Could be similar to `display`, adding `type` & `data`. 

```json
"metadata": {
    "type": "json",
    "data": "{\"test\": true}"
}
```

**Option 2**

Remove completely. Metadata could be grabbed by the `credentialSubject` field. The VC spec does not have requirements over the types of information that could be mentioned `credentialSubject`, but because this is where the "holder" and "subject" properties live, it makes sense that any sort of additional metadata lives here. This will be consistent and interoperable with other verifiable credentials that are not Blockcerts, and other verifiable credential wallets. 

**Option 3** 

Leave as is. It is not a requirement that we change this at all. Going with option 2 would remove the need to have some possible duplicate information, but leaving as is would allow issuers to make explicit the metadata information they want to be displayed to a user and parsed by systems. 


Note that leaving `metadataJson` or changing to `metadata` will more than likely be specific to Blockcerts and not understood by the wider VC ecosystem. The recommended approach would be to just pull additional metadata information from `credentialSubject` (option 2).


## Badge Claim
Going off of the paper written from a previous RWoT titled [Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.md), an example badge claim we can create for those that want a similar experience in the VC ecosystem could look like below:

```json
"credentialSubject": {
        "id": "https://example.com/profiles/bob",
        "bc:holds": {
            "id": "https://example.com/badgeclasses/123",
            "type": "BadgeClass",
            "name": "Certificate of Accomplishment",
            "image": "data:image/png;base64,...",
            "description": "A badge describing great accomplishments",
            "criteria": {
                "narrative": "Perform tasks of valor and wit."
            },
            "issuer": {
                "type": "Profile",
                "id": "https://example.com/profiles/alice",
                "name": "Example Issuer",
                "url": "http://example.com",
                "email": "test@example.com"
            }
        }
    },
"bc:evidence": {
    "id": "https://example.org/portfolios/25",
    "name": "Bob's Portfolio",
    "narrative": "Bob worked hard to develop a good portfolio",
    "genre": "ePortfolio"
}
```

`bc:holds` can be used instead of `obi:holds` since Open Badges has not moved to VC or created this type of claim yet. This will allow easier migration to Blockcerts V3.

Alternatively, if & when Open Badges adopts Verifiable Credentials fully and makes this sort of claim standard (issuing, verifying, backpacks, etc.), issuers could switch to using `obi:holds` & `obi:evidence` instead of `bc:holds` & `bc:evidence`.


This type of claim is not required as part of the Blockcerts V3 standard. Any type of claim can be made.

              "id": "did:example:23adb1f712ebc6f1c276eba4dfa",

          }
      }
  },

    "name": "Bob's Portfolio",
    "narrative": "Bob worked hard to develop a good portfolio",
    "genre": "ePortfolio"
  },
  "metadata": {

    "data": "{\"class\": \"2019\"}"
  },
  "display": {
    "type": "html",
    "data": "<p>This subject has received this Certificate of Accomplishment</p>"
  },

  }
}
```

There were several options outlined above, this specific example used `metadata` as an object, `display` as an object, `holds` & `evidence` for OB-like `credentialSubject` types, and `MerkleProof2019` as the new `signature`/`proof`. This is just an example and not necessarily of a "recommended" route for Blockcerts V3.  

## Issuer Profile

By moving to a Verifiable Credential standard that is capable of utilizing Decentralized Identifiers, we are now removing the reliance of URLs inside certificates. 

As an Open Badge extension (and while VC's &  DIDs were still getting standardized), we had a requirement that Issuer Profiles had to be resolvable via https for information such as public key, revocation lists, and even metadata such as name & image to be gathered when verifying a certificate. 

The Verifiable Credential spec does not require that VCs are issued using DIDs, so it's proposed that we do not make this requirement as well. We may want to continue supporting URL based issuer profiles as well, though we might need to make some changes to support specific key links. 


### Issuer Profile as a DID

There are a few things we may need outside of a normal DID resolution to provide the same UX we have today in Blockcerts V2.

Here's an example of a DID when resolved: 

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2019/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "RsaVerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY...END PUBLIC KEY-----\r\n"
  }],
  "service": [{
    "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
    "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
  }]
}
```

One of the main requirements to verify the integrity of a certificate and proof that a certain issuer did indeed issue it is the `#key` field in the `authentication` property of a DID. 

One would be able to link a signing key by referencing the DID and property: `did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1`. 


However, at minimum, there are a few other things we need to carry over to a DID profile. 

- Name
- URL
- introductionURL
- revocationList
- mage
- email

I'm proposing a service endpoint for BlockcertsIssuer that contains some of this metadata, as well as a BlockcertsRevocation URL to handle certificate revocations. 

#### BlockcertsIssuerService

```json
"service": [{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#BlockcertsIssuer",
  "type": "BlockcertsIssuerService",
  "name": "University of Example,
  "URL": "https://example.com", 
  "imageURL": "https://example.com/img.png",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/introductionURL" 
}]
```

When resolving the issuer DID `did:example:123456789abcdefghi`, we can then look for types that related to `BlockcertsIssuerService` to check for metadata and allow recipients to post their own DIDs/public keys to the issuer, much like we do today for URL based Issuer Profiles.

It's possible that we can include `BlockcertsRevocationService` as a field in the `BlockcertsIssuerService` instead of a standalone ServiceEndpoint. May need to research best practice amongst ServiceEndpoints. If we were to separate it into its own field, this could look like below.


#### BlockcertsRevocationService


**Option 1:** Check revocation for a single ID at a time.

```json
"service": [{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#BlockcertsRevocation",
  "type": "BlockcertsRevocationService",
  "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/revocationEndpoint"
}]
```

If an issuer wants the ability to revoke any of their issued certificates, they can add `BlockcertsRevocationService` to their list of DID services. 

This will allow a Blockcerts verifier to check the revocation status of a certificate by making a `GET` call to `https://example.com/revocationEndpoint/{certId}`. 


**Option 2** Check a revocation list for the ID.

An alternative method of making this `BlockcertsRevocationService` would be to make it a `BlockcertsRevocationListService` instead, similar to how we do `revocationList` today.  

```json
"service": [{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#BlockcertsRevocationList",
  "type": "BlockcertsRevocationListService",
  "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/revocationListEndpoint"
}]
```

There are pros and cons to both. 

Option 1 allows a verifier to only obtain and see the revocation status of a single certificate. A verifier would not be able to see the revocation status of certificates in which they do not have possession of. A standard practice of making UUID-based certificate IDs should prohibit verifiers from guessing another certificate ID. 

However, option 1 allows the issuer to see, log, monitor (etc.) against a specific certificate. They would be able to see what IP address, origin, etc. was trying to verify a specific individual's certificate and then infer certain things. 

Since option 2 is pulling an entire list of revocation events, it is not revealed to the issuer who is getting verified, but it does reveal to verifiers every revocation event they have ever made and why. In the case of a large revocation list, the verifier may have to wait for all of the revocations to get processed and retrieved. 


There has not been a very good consensus yet on what method of revocation/status lists should be used for Verifiable Credentials, and thus no standards yet. Ideally, there is a generic `RevocationServiceEndpoint` not specific to Blockcerts revocation lists, but to not conflict with other methods that might be created, I'm suggesting we label this as a Blockcerts-specific revocation endpoint. 

Instead of the Blockcerts standard picking one of these two methods, we may support both and allow issuers to decide for themselves which makes better sense for their organization. 


#### Example

Here is an example of what an issuer DID might look like when resolved, picking option 2 as an example for revocations: 

```json
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2019/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }],
  "service": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#BlockcertsIssuer",
    "type": "BlockcertsIssuerService",
    "name": "University of Example,
    "URL": "https://example.com", 
    "imageURL": "https://example.com/img.png",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/introductionURL"
  }, {
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#BlockcertsRevocationList",
    "type": "BlockcertsRevocationListService",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/revocationListEndpoint"
  }]
}
```


### Issuer Profile as a URL in V3

Here is an example of an Issuer Profile in Blockcerts v2: 

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2"
  ],
  "type": "Profile",
  "id": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json",
  "name": "University of Learning",
  "url": "https://www.issuer.org",
  "introductionURL": "https://www.issuer.org/intro/",
  "publicKey": [
    {
      "id": "ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:msBCHdwaQ7N2ypBYupkp6uNxtr9Pg76imj",
      "created": "2017-06-29T14:48:03.814936+00:00"
    }
  ],
  "revocationList": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/revocation-list-testnet.json",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
  "email": "contact@issuer.org"
}
```

Comparing that to the example issuer DID above, the only thing needed to change is mapping `publicKeys` to `authentication`. 


```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2"
  ],
  "type": "Profile",
  "id": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json",
  "name": "University of Learning",
  "url": "https://www.issuer.org",
  "introductionURL": "https://www.issuer.org/intro/",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/issuer-testnet.json",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }],
  "revocationList": "https://www.blockcerts.org/samples/2.0/revocation-list-testnet.json",
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
  "email": "contact@issuer.org"
}
```

This will allow us to link directly to a specific key used for signing a Verifiable Credential, which is a standard way of finding the key, instead of in the current Blockcerts model of checking the blockchain issuing key against all public keys that an issuer has claimed ownership of.


## Considerations

### Backwards Compatibility

All aspects of V2 shall continue to operate as it does today, such as accepting an organization as a recipient, displaying metadata and HTML, verifying a credential, etc. 

Programmatic decisions as to how to accept an issuer, what information to display and how to display it, etc. shall be made based on the Blockcerts version outlined in `@context`: 

```json
"@context": [
    "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2"
  ]
```

In cases where the issuer profile is a DID instead of a URL, universal DID resolvers shall exist throughout the ecosystem that will resolve it down to a profile in which case Blockcerts version can then be checked. 

### Existing V2 / Open Badges extension support

While Blockcerts adopts the Verifiable Credential standard and moves off of the Open Badges standard directly, there may be a desire for organizations to continue issuing recognized Open Badges extensions. Blockcerts V2 credential creation and issuing can still be maintained via versioning. Any critical changes necessary can be made and published as a new Python Package under the V2 versioning (ex. `v2.0.33`). This can be done out of good faith by the community but make no guarantees for how long this might be done. We would love to invite anyone wishing to make critical update changes for V2 to make code contributions that we can merge into the official V2 branch that will be created.

### Issuing Blockcerts V3 that is Open Badge Compliant

As mentioned previously, we can continue making Blockcerts that can be Open Badges. Based on the work by Kim Hamilton Duffy & Nate Otto at a previous Rebooting the Web of Trust: [Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.md).

Blockcerts V3 shall make no requirements that one must issue a BC that is both a Verifiable Credential and an Open Badge. By making this stance, Blockcerts can be better supported throughout the ecosystem of Verifiable Credentials. Any schema and `CredentialSubject` type can be supported. 

In the end, it will be up to IMS Global and the Open Badges community to support Verifiable Credential-based Open Badges through the schema changes outlined in "Open Badges are Verifiable Credentials" and/or the official Open Badges verifiers. There are several options of ways to issue Open Badges this way, which may include the introduction of `holds` into the standard or extracting a full badge from a Verifiable Credential. Note, issuing a full badge inside of a Verifiable Credential is not a standard/recommended way to use VC's, though it is technically still a VC. 

### Breaking Changes Summary

There are a few breaking changes that are necessary as we move to Verifiable Credentials and several optional things that may be breaking changes if we wish to implement them. As mentioned, V2 will continue to behave as is, but to issue V3 credentials and to support V2 & V3 URL-based issuer profiles, please review the changes below. 

#### Issuer Profile

Existing Issuer Profiles could continue to operate but an additional field needs to be implemented. As mentioned above, `authentication` in place of `publicKeys` to allow for directly linking to a specific key. If one wanted to support both V2 Blockcerts & V3 Blockcerts using the same URL-based Issuer Profile, one could add `authentication` in addition to `publicKeys`. 

For DID based Issuer Profiles, it's understood that you'd be creating a new issuer profile and will need to continue to maintain your URL based profile for every credential you've issued (unless you reactively issue V3 for every V2 credential you've ever issued). DID issuer profiles will act similar in nature to URL-based Issuer Profiles but under the DID-document schema model. See [issuer profile as a did](#issuer-profile-as-a-did) for a summary of these changes and options.

#### Data Model

The data model will change for V3, so if you've previously created a template using the open-source [`cert-tools`](https://github.com/blockchain-certificates/cert-tools) project, you'd need to create a new one that is a valid Verifiable Credential. Please review [blockcerts as VC implementation](#blockcerts-as-vc-implementation) to see how V2 will map to V3 and some of the proposed options that Blockcerts V3 could take. We will more than likely have some sample V3 credentials in the `cert-tools` project as we start implementing V3.

If you wish, you could continue issuing a badge-like credential by utilizing `hold` & `evidence` as described [here](#badge-claim) to minimize the data changes required. Otherwise, you're free to create a new Verifiable Credential type. 

There are a few optional changes that may break your existing templates as well. Please click the in-page links to jump to the summaries above: 

- [display](#display)
- [metadata](#metadata)

These fields have not been standardized before, but we do have the opportunity to make these improvements while moving to a new major version number. If it interests you, please give any feedback you might have. It may be advisable to implement these features in the future to minimize the scope of work and breaking changes for V3.

Note: While these changes were identified as needed changes early on, there may still be other breaking changes that are made known during the development of Blockcerts V3.

## Summary

The current Blockcerts V2 standard and the Verifiable Credentials standard has a lot of similarities that easily map to each other in many ways. Blockcerts can achieve much of the same functionality and more by utilizing the Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifiers standard. There are many options for how to map specific properties, but in the end Blockchain Proofs, Issuer Profiles/Identities, Recipient Ownership, and the aspects of life-long credentials are better supported/standardized, giving options for doing so in a more decentralized way. From here, we incredibly value community feedback and support. Based on the conversations and decisions preferred by the community, we can work on an official specification for Blockcerts V3.
