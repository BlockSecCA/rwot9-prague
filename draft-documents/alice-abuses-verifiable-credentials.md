Alice has a valuable credential, and she wants to somehow cheat the system.  What are the ways that Alice might try to abuse the system, and how can systems mitigate the threat?  This paper will model threats surrounding a malicious holder of a verifiable credential, referring back to existing threat models and attack definitions.
