> This paper describes current approaches and architectures, derived requirements, design goals, and dangers that implementers should be aware of when implementing data storage. This paper also explores the base assumptions of these sorts of systems such as providing privacy-respecting mechanisms for storing, indexing, and retrieving encrypted data, as well as data portability.
