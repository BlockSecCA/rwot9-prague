==Abstract==

Social key recovery allows users to collaborate with each other to securely recover their secrets instead of using centralized account reset procedures. Shamir secret sharing can be used as an implementation of social key recovery, where a secret can be split into a number of shares with various threshold requirements or in the future any arbitrary monotone boolean function describing a recovery policy.

SatoshiLabs' SLIP 39 is one proposed implementation of Shamir secret sharing with mnemonics. SLIP 39 implements simple Shamir secret sharing plus a two-level fixed threshold group, including a mnemonic text encoding scheme and an encryption scheme as well.

This proposal leverages SLIP 39 but allows for some forward-compatible extendibility and it is curve independent. In particular, this new proposal includes a binary format, additional metadata (such as birthdate), and greater flexibility of threshold specification. It also has some optional templates for pre-defined or pre-parameterized threshold requirements. The design is intended to make it possible to audit the independent parts of the proposal and make the proposal more modular. The proposal is intended to be able to support future upgrades like verifiable secret sharing and MuSig.

A reference implementation is included.

==Motivation==

Secure storage of secret keys is critically important to bitcoin users. Traditionally, users make at least one backup of their master secret or recovery information. By distributing this backup to multiple other individuals, such as friends and family members, the user is able to increase redundancy and backup integrity at the cost of allowing one of the trusted individuals to abscond with all of the funds. Instead, Shamir secret sharing provides a mechanism for a user to backup a secret split into shards and distribute those shards to a number of custodians in a manner that can prevent loss even if one or a few of those parties become compromised.

<b>TODO</b>: add text about why SLIP 39 is insufficient

SLIP 39 is optimized for the absolute minimum size because of the inherent limitations of writing down mnemonics. For example, for a 3-of-5 setup using SLIP 39, the SLIP 39 dealer would have to write down 100 words and 60 words to do recovery.

It is also desirable for a Shamir secret sharing proposal to be forwards compatible with future upgrades like verifiable secret sharing and MuSig.

==Use cases==

<b>Social key recovery</b>: a user and his family, friends and colleagues collaborate to keep Shamir shards on behalf of the user.

<b>Commercial custodian</b>: a company has various teams of employees that are tasked with managing private keys and signing bitcoin transactions.

==Social key recovery==

Ideally an implementation of social key recovery should balancing numerous competing goals:

* Key recovery should require approval of many individuals so as to minimize potential for theft or deliberate key compromise by a small malicious subset of users.

* Key recovery should require the smallest acceptable threshold so as to prevent loss of funds from destroyed/lost/inaccessible shares.

* Key recovery requiring interaction with too many individuals is undesirable, as each interaction must involve re-authentication at the inconvenience of all involved.

* Social trust is not uniformly distributed among different social circles, such as friends, business acquaintances, and family. Individuals may be fungible within a certain circle of trust, but not more broadly. A family member is not the same as a “business partner.”


==Shamir secret sharing==

<b>TODO</b>: rewrite

Shamir secret sharing (SSS) is a cryptographic mechanism describing how to split a secret into *N* unique parts, where any *T* of them are required to reconstruct the secret. First, a polynomial *f* of degree *T* &minus; 1 is constructed and each party is given a corresponding point - an integer input *x* to the polynomial and the corresponding output *f*(*x*).

When any *T* points are provided, they exactly define the polynomial. Usually the value of the polynomial *f*(0) is used as the shared secret. In this specification the shared secret is stored as *f*(255). More details on SSS can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing).

Note that it is important to understand that the secret must be reassembled on a single machine or by a single user. Hence, the scheme always reduces to 1-of-n. Ideally this 1-of-n individual is the original user, which makes this scheme particularly useful for password recovery.

==Policy specification==

We propose using a simple version of miniscript with only ANDs, ORs, and a Shamir k-of-n threshold primitive parameterized by k and n.

==Envelope Format==

Many use cases have multiple reconstruction policies which trade-off thresholds among the groups involved.  With SLIP-39 compatible secret sharing this necessarily involves separate shards for each policy.  Additionally, to retain additional metadata information (such as a birthday timestamp), there is a need to store variable-length data alongside each secret share.  We therefore define an envelope format to hold these shards and an encrypted blog containing the required metadata information.

To provide integrity and authentication, we derive two secret values from the seed entroy using HMAC-SHA256 keyed with "shamir" as the key derivation function.  The first secret is interpreted as a secp256k1 private key.  The second secret is used to key the encryption of a metadata blob, if present, using the AES-GMAC-CTR encryption with authentication mode.

The secp256k1 secret has an associated public key.  This public key serves as the identifier for the entire Shamir secret share deck, and is prefixed to the beginning of the envelope encoding, followed by the encrypted metadata.  Then each shard in SLIP-39 format, along with a Schnorr signature of the metadata + shard using the secp256k1 key.

  Public key
  32 bytes (secp256k1-zkp Schnorr public key)

  Encrypted metadata
  X bytes (variable-length string)

  Authenticated Shards
  N structs:

    Shard Data
    SLIP-39 compatible binary

    Signature
    64 bytes (secp256k1-zkp Schnorr signature)

The dealer creates all the shards of a deck at the same time.  Then for each recipient they construct an envelope which contains only the shards for that recipient, and encrypt the envelope to that user using the encrypted envelope format:

  Public key
  32 bytes (same as above)

  (Same contents as the envelope, but without duplicating the prefixed public key.)

The encryption uses the symmetric secret derived using ECDH with the seed entropy and the recipient's public key.  For decryption, the recipient can reconstruct the same secret using their private key and the public key which identifies the share, and thereby decode the remaining contents of the envelope.

In reconstruction the collector no longer has access to the original seed entropy, so a secure channel must be used to transmit the unencrypted shards back for reconstruction.

==Glossary==

Shard dealer: An individual that has a secret that is sharded using this secret sharing scheme. The user makes a number of shards that are dealt out to different users to turn each user into a shard custodian.

Deck: A collection of shards that together can be combined (in at least one way) to reconstruct the sharded secret.

Deck identifier: Derived from the sharded secret. It is the public key derived from the sharded secret unmodified with no derivation and no other modification. The deck identifier is a public key that uniquely identifies the deck. This key can sign each shard.

Script policy: A script that specifies a policy for how the deck's secret (seed entropy) can be reconstructed from some combination of shards.

Quorum: Any set of shards sufficient to meet the script policy for reconstruction.

Shard: A shard includes unencrypted metadata, an unencrypted Y value and checksum, and private encrypted data.

Shard unencrypted metadata (public metadata): Data associated with a shard that describes the shard and the deck among other things. This includes birthdate, deck identifier information, and so on.

Shard value: The mathematical or cryptographic value that can be used in the secret sharing scheme to reconstruct the sharded secret. This is the y value.

Private data (encrypted) (encrypted blob or deck blob): Encrypted data transferred with each shard. The decryption key can be computed by recombining all the shards.

Shard custodian: A user that holds a number of shards, possibly from multiple different decks.

Shard pool: A shard custodian can use software that implements a shard pool that contains their collection of shards they are responsible for. The shard pool allows for querying over the set of shards to find particular shards to respond to a request.

Sharded secret: Used to create the derived secret. This is used both as symmetric key and as a private key. This is a high entropy secret.

Derived secret: The derived secret is used to decrypt the identical private data associated with each shard.

Archive shard

==Privacy considerations==

It would be good to keep the policy private from all of the shard custodians.
